# Rendor.Visual
Rendor.Visual is a simple 2D rendering library for .NET Core. The main goal of this library is to provide a unified API for drawing 2D graphics on different platforms using such backends as OpenGL and in the future Vulkan, DirectX and Metal.

## Features
This library attempts to succeed in these key areas:
1. The size of the library should be as small as possible.
1. The library should be as simple as possible, so that others who are willing to learn how to draw 2D graphics can easily understand the code.				
1. The entire library should be written in C#.

## Supported Platforms
- Windows (OpenGL)
